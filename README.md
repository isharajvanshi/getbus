The purpose of this module is to track the buses at a specific Seattle bus stop. Currently, this module returns the minutes away, bus number, and number stops away. Occasionally, it will return the values of a bus that has already left because it is connected to the OneBusAway information. It returns the information of two or three buses at the given bus stop. In order to change the bus stop from the one in the busmodule.js library, go to http://pugetsound.onebusaway.org/where/standard/#m(route)route(1_102581) to find your specific stop and changed the "stopId" on line 7 of busmodule.js. 
Currently, the module returns the information using console.log, but it could be changed to return the values instead. The function works fairly well right now and can easily be changed for other bus stops.
